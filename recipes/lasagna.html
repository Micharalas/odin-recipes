    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>An easy lasagna recipe that saves me lots of time. This recipe is simple and satisfies 
        everyone in the family. Try it tonight!</p>
    <p>This recipe saved the day when I had 5 college kids drop by for dinner unexpectedly. 
        I used the "no-boil" lasagna noodles, mild Italian sausage instead of hamburg, and 
        60 ounces of spaghetti sauce, leaving out the water. I also layered in some fresh 
        baby spinach leaves. It was a big hit!! Thanks!!</p>
